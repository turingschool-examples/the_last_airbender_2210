As a user,
When I visit "/"
And I Select "Fire Nation" from the select field
(Note: Use the existing select field)
And I click "Search For Members"
Then I should be on page "/search"
Then I should see the total number of people who live in the Fire Nation. (should be close to 100)
And I should see a list with the detailed information for the first 25 members of the Fire Nation.

And for each of the members I should see:
- The name of the member (and their photo, if they have one)
- The list of allies or "None"
- The list of enemies or "None"
- Any affiliations that the member has
